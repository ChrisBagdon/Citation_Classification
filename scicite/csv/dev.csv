My results give one way to interpret the empirical evidence from Baker et al. (2012) that suggests that fiscal policy uncertainty has been an important force behind the fall in consumption investment and output that we have seen during the Great Recession. In addition my model is consistent with the relatively small effects reported by Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2012b) and Born and Pfeifer (2011) since both studies do not consider the impact of the ZLB. A complementary strand of literature examines the effects of expected fiscal consolidation. Work by Denes Eggertsson and Gilbukh (2012) shows that the form of a fiscal consolidation can determine the effectiveness of changes in fiscal policy when the ZLB binds. Bi Leeper and Leith (2012) show that uncertainty about the timing and form of a fiscal consolidation can have important effects on the economy.,result

Still the general notion that interference is mainly due to cue overload at the time of retrieval lived on despite the fact that multiple efforts to demonstrate that cue-overload effects apply to everyday forgetting (not just laboratory forgetting) generally suggested just the opposite (Underwood & Ekstrand 1967).

But the mere fact that cue-overload effects sometimes play a role does not mean that the role is a substantial one.

The other condition ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ a selective differential ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ is clearly met.

Our analyses suggest that the possibility of rapid evolutionary change in juvenile migration tactic within the last 50‚Äö√Ñ√¨60 years. Credence is lent to this hypothesis by research that has concluded that evolutionary changes have been experienced by introduced Chinook salmon populations over a 90-year period in New Zealand.

The real-world spaces that surround information users have been diversely called everything from personal information environments (Kwasnik 1991; Malone 1983) to personal information management (PIM) systems (Barreau 1995) and personal spaces of information (Jones 2007). Drawing upon interviews with academics Lee (2003) proposes a model of three concentric zones of information that surround a user: “immediate” within arm’s reach or a few footsteps away; “adjacent” such as a nearby university library; and “outside” such as a more distant bookstore. Speaking largely from an objectifying stance and adopting Lee’s concept of the “immediate information space” this paper focuses on a visual research method—photography— that seems particularly well suited to learning more about settings and their accompanying information phenomena. A variety of investigative approaches may be used to study immediate information space. Jones (2007) suggests ethnography combined with design methodologies and places emphasis on context and situation including contextual inquiry (Beyer & Holtzblatt 1998) situated activity (Suchman 1983) and situated design (Greenbaum & Kyng 1991). Naumer and Fisher (2007) recommend naturalistic inquiry (Lincoln & Guba 1985) and the data-gathering methods of unobtrusive observation interviews diaries text analysis pictures and videos.

Arctic ground squirrel populations in the boreal forest are smaller (Donker and Krebs 2011) and appear to exhibit demographic characteristics indicative of sink habitat types. The extirpation of ground squirrels from the boreal forest (Gillis et al. 2005; Donker and Krebs 2011) poor active-season survival low recruitment rates immigration from nearby low elevation-meadow habitat and population growth rates <1.0 provide convincing evidence that the boreal forest functions as a sink habitat for arctic ground squirrels. Conversely arctic ground squirrel populations in nearby low elevation-meadow habitat appear to be stable and self-sustaining and appear to function as sources for populations in the boreal forest. Juveniles in the present study moved from low elevationmeadow habitat into boreal forest habitat which suggests that low-elevation meadows have the capacity to support a nearby population sink. These findings also validate Gillis et al.’s (2005) suggestion that boreal forest populations are functioning as population sinks and that nearby meadow habitats may provide the immigrants required to sustain arctic ground squirrel populations in the forest.,background
