The contradictory results of the above-mentioned authors can lead to considerable miscalculations, whatever correlation is taken. In this paper all major studies on the influence of pressure on mass transfer phenomena in gas-liquid systems and reactors are reviewed critically. Points of agreement and conflict are indicated and discussed in order to improve understanding of the mass transfer 0255-2701/89/%3.50 Chem. Eng.
